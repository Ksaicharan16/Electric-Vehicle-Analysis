Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project â€“ Tableau Dashboard 

I'm excited to share my recent Tableau project where I explored data trends in the electric vehicle (EV) industry! Here are some key insights I gathered from the dashboard:Total EVs Analyzed:

Average Electric Range: Across all vehicles, the average electric range stands at 165.9 miles, showcasing how EV technology has evolved to provide more range for users.

Growth in EV Models: The number of EVs by model year shows a sharp growth from 2012 to 2019, peaking at 10,815 vehicles in 2018. However, there was a noticeable drop in 2020, likely due to the pandemic, with only 1,172 vehicles added that year.

Top EV Manufacturers:

Tesla leads the market by a huge margin, contributing 25,858 vehicles, followed by Nissan (11,003 vehicles) and Chevrolet (8,848 vehicles).
The Tesla Model 3 alone accounts for 14,103 vehicles, making it the most popular EV in the dataset.
Geographic Distribution:

California is the clear leader in EV adoption, with 55,790 vehicles, far surpassing other states.
States like Texas, New York, and Florida show growing interest, but still have a long way to catch up with California.
EV Eligibility:

Interestingly, 42.75% of the vehicles have "Unknown" status in terms of Clean Air Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility. 46.33% are eligible, indicating significant potential for growth in promoting environmentally friendly transportation.
This project provided a deeper understanding of how electric vehicle adoption is progressing and which areas show the greatest potential for future growth.
